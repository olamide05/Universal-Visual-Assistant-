# Universal Visual Assistant (UVA)

**A conversational AI app for image analysis and secure file sharing.**

UVA uses AI to analyze images (objects, text, charts) and supports secure file uploads (images, PDFs) with shareable links and AI summaries. The MVP includes:
- Object recognition (e.g., identify a bag, get brand/price).
- File uploads to AWS S3 with shareable links.
- Basic chatbot for image result discussions.

Built with **Python**, **Flask**, and **CLIP (Hugging Face)**, UVA targets e-commerce, education, and SMBs in 2025’s AI boom (36% CAGR).
